## Hi there 👋

**I'm Nathan.** I like coding, working with people to make sense of data, and I want to make the world a bit kinder and more equitable.

- 🔭 Currently developing an R Shiny app to help instructors identify racial disparities in student outcomes. (Files stored locally, using Git)
- 🌱 Just started learning Python, using the [#pydytuesday](https://github.com/posit-dev/python-tidytuesday) resources and datasets!
- 👯 Come say hi in the weekly [Data Science Hangout](https://posit.co/dsh) hosted by Posit -- it's an awesome community to be part of.
- 🔎 Looking for a full-time position where I can work with other passionate people.
- 💬 Ask me about Quarto reports, Qualtrics surveys, Shiny apps, amigurumi crochet projects, or hiking!
