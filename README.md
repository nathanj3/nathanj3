## Hi there 👋

**I'm Nathan.** I like coding, working with people to make sense of their data, and I want to make the world a bit kinder and more equitable.

- 🔭 I’m currently developing an R Shiny app to help instructors identify racial disparities in student outcomes. (Files stored locally, using Git)
- 🌱 I just started learning Python, using the #pydytuesday resources and datasets!
- 👯 Come say hi in the weekly [Data Science Hangout](https://posit.co/dsh) hosted by Posit -- it's an awesome community to be part of.
- 🔎 Looking for a full-time position where I can work with other passionate people.
- 💬 Ask me about Quarto reports, Qualtrics surveys, Shiny apps, amigurumi crochet projects, or hiking!
- ✉ How to reach me: email jeffery [dot] nathan [dot] r {at} gmail [dot] com
